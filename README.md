# Infograph-Task

# Description
This is a web application project that utilizes React and Node.js to create an interactive map experience. It enables users to interact with pointers on the map, including adding new ones, modifying existing ones, and removing them. The map functionality is supported by the Leaflet library, while the data is handled by a Node.js backend.

# Capabilities include:

1- Displaying a map with marked locations.

2- Enabling users to place new pointers by clicking on the map.

3- Allowing users to modify existing pointers by selecting a pointer and using the "Update" button.

4- Providing the option to remove pointers.

5- Implementing pointer clustering to enhance map performance.


# To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

Backend (Node.js):

Go to the server directory in your terminal and start the backend server by running the command: "node .\app.js"

Frontend (React.js):

In your terminal, navigate to the front directory.
Install npm by running the command: "npm install"

# Instructions for Usage:

1- Click on any location on the map to obtain its coordinates. Fill in the "name" and "note" fields, then proceed to add the pointer.

2- To delete a pointer, simply click on it. A popup will appear, and you can click on "delete" to remove it.

3- To edit a pointer, click on it. Its details will be displayed in the fields below the map. After clicking "update" in the popup, the pointer will become draggable, allowing you to choose a new location.
